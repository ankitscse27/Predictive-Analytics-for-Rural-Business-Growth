# üìà Predictive Sales Forecaster using XGBoost

An advanced, object-oriented machine learning pipeline designed to provide **rural and small businesses** with highly accurate, data-driven sales predictions. It leverages the power of **XGBoost** to transform raw historical data into **actionable inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies**.



## ‚ú® Why XGBoost? The Predictive Engine

We use a high-performance **XGBoost** model. Think of it as a **"team of experts"** (*Gradient Boosting*) where each new expert's sole job is to correct the mistakes of the previous one. This powerful, iterative approach captures complex patterns, like seasonality and local event impact, with incredible accuracy.

## üéØ Core Features & Actionable Insights

| Feature Category | Description | Business Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Feature Engineering** | Automatically creates powerful features from time-series data: **Lag Features** (e.g., yesterday's sales), **Rolling Window Averages**, and **Cyclical Features** (sin/cos transformations for months/weekdays to capture seasonality). | Turns dates into data the model understands, leading to highly predictive signals. |
| **Intelligent Tuning** | Uses **GridSearchCV** to automatically find the optimal settings (hyperparameters) for the XGBoost model specific to your data, ensuring maximum accuracy and reliability. | Guarantees the best possible performance without manual, time-consuming effort. |
| **Robust Training** | Implements **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting on the training data and reduce computational time. | Ensures the model generalizes well to future, unseen sales data. |
| **Actionable Insights** | Generates a **Feature Importance** chart showing the biggest drivers of sales (e.g., weekends, holidays). Provides clear metrics: **MAE** (average prediction error in dollars) and **R¬≤** (variance explained). | The model tells you *why* a prediction was made, enabling smarter decision-making. |
| **Confidence** | Produces a final forecast with a **95% Confidence Interval**, providing a realistic range for expected outcomes. | Allows for robust risk assessment and inventory buffer planning. |

### File: `Advanced_Sales_Forecaster.py`

This **object-oriented Python script** encapsulates the entire end-to-end sales forecasting pipeline within a `SalesForecaster` class. It manages data simulation, sophisticated feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model training, and the final generation of the evaluation dashboard and 14-day sales forecast with confidence intervals.
